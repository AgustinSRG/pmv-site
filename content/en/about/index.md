# Motivation of the project

This is a personal, free and open source project.

The goal when developing the project was to make a media management tool with a web interface similar to YouTube,
while keeping the media files encrypted in disk.

# Why encryption?

When storing your personal pictures, videos or audio recordings, if you store them unencrypted in your computer, any malware that is able to infect your device will be able to easily get them from the file system. By encrypting them, it makes harder for those media files to be stolen. 

Also, by being encrypted, you can easily make backups of them in cloud storage services like Google Drive, without giving Google the ability to peek into your personal media files.

# Why a web application?

By making it a web application, its usage becomes very flexible. You can to run the backend in a computer in your LAN or a remote server and you are able to use the app from all the devices connected to the Internet without any extra installation. 

Also, web interfaces are easier to develop to work in multiple devices and they offer standard features already implemented that are required for the app, like the video player.
