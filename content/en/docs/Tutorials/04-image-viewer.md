When selecting an **image** in the media vault, the **image viewer** will be used in order to display it.

The PersonalMediaVault image viewer is very similar to the video player:

 - At the top-left, you have the image title
 - At the top-right, you have a button to open the image metadata editor.
 - At the bottom you have the viewer controls.

 - Click the scale button, or press the **Space** bar, in order to toggle the image fitting mode.
 - Drag the scale control or press the **+** and **-** keys to increase or decrease the scale by 10% respectively.
 - You can press the **Shift** key, along with the **+** and **-** keys to increase or decrease the scale by 1% respectively.

You can find several options:

The viewer editor allows you to change any aspect of the image.

In the **General** tab you can change the title of the image, its description and thumbnail. 

In the **Tags** tab you can change the media tags. You can use the tags to find the media later when searching for it.

You also have other tabs we explain in detail in the sections below.

### Image notes

You can add annotation to the image by clicking the option in the context menu, or pressing the **N** key. This will toggle a mode where you can drag in order to add notes to the image, while being able to move and resize the existing ones.

When out of the image notes editor mode, they will be displayed as translucid squares that will display its corresponding text by hovering or clicking on them.

You can use image notes, for example, to name elements of the image, add extra information or translate texts in a foreign language.

You can also change the image notes in text mode by going to the **Image Notes** tab of the viewer editor, very useful to import and export notes.

### Attachments

You can add attachments to the video by going to the **Attachments** tab of the viewer editor.

Attachments are arbitrary files you can store in the vault along with the media file, for example the original uncompressed image or the assets used to make it.

### Resolutions

In the **Resolutions** tab of the viewer editor, you will be able to resize the image to different resolutions, in order to display it in smaller screens without wasting bandwidth.

Once a resolution is available, you will be able to select it from the viewer configuration menu.

### Danger zone

In the **Danger zone** tab of the viewer editor, you can:

 - Re-encode the image, in order to attempt to fix encoding errors.
 - Delete the image from the vault, which requires confirmation. You can also use the **Delete** key.
