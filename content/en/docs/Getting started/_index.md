In this section we explain how to download, install and run PersonalMediaVault for the first time.

## Docker

Running the vault in an isolated container is the most secure way of running it, gives access to all the features and allows for a fine-grained configuration:

 - [Run it with Docker](./docker/)
 - [Run it with Docker (with AI features)](./docker-with-ai/)

However, this may be a bit complex for non technical users. So, if you only need a local vault, go to the [Installation](#installation) section instead.

## Installation

Check out the [Releases](https://github.com/AgustinSRG/PersonalMediaVault/releases) section on GitHub to find pre-compiled installation packages.

Depending on your operating system, we offer you the following installation guides:

 - [Installation on Linux](./install-linux/)
 - [Installation on Windows](./install-windows/)

The installation guides also explain how to create a vault and run it in your system.

## Compilation from source code

If you do not find any suitable package for your system, or you prefer to compile the project yourself, you can:

 - [Compile it from source code](./compile/)

## Next steps

After installing and creating your first vault, you may want to check out the [Tutorials]({{< baseurl >}}docs/tutorials/) section for more guides and tutorial on how to use PersonalMediaVault.
